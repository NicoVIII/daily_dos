# Project Summary
This Project aims to make people do invest their time more carefully. (And hopefully teaches the authors more about F# and Vue :D )
You will be able to plan your freetime with stuff, you really like by specifying your available hours and activities.
Plan, how much time you want to invest into those activities how frequently you want to engage them.
The webservice then trys to organize these activities or proposes them to you, if you got unexpected free time and motivation.
